            "I did pretty good in high school, it didnt pose any challenge. I then went to college and studied something I really loved; History. However, I got really sick during my first year...REALLY sick.\n" +
                    "I tried for 3 years to catch up but I failed miserably. I had wasted 3 years of my life for nothing. Just a whole lot of money down the drain, I was gutted. I also had been living on my own for those same 3 years so I had debts greater than mount Everest. So you can safely say I felt like shit.\n" +
                    "Then, I pulled my shit together. I tried to find something I really liked which is music. I started up my own company and started to get some clients to earn some money. One year later I was doing music fulltime as a performer, Mix-engineer and Ghost-producer for mid-level artists.\n" +
                    "2 years later I've paid off all my debts, have a huge record-deal with one of the biggest labels in the world and I am performing all over Europe. I'm flying to Italy next weekend to perform there and I've just bought my first brand new car. Life's been good, I had some really shitty times but through hard work and persistence I've found a way to make it work and so can you.\n" +

            "I just thought I'd share my story of social anxiety, from the comfort of anonymity through Reddit. This will probably take a few minutes to read but I think it could help people that have or still do feel the same way I'm 22, from Ireland, and have suffered with this disorder for as long as I can remember, however the condition is probably not as bad as it was in previous years now.\n" +
                    "I can remember avoiding social situations for as long as I could recall, always really only felt the happiest when I was alone. school and college was the most difficult times for me.\n" +
                    "When I went to secondary school I can remember my first day so well, sitting in a classroom of people I never meet and the anxiety would kick in. I'm sitting there around people I have never met before, my heart races, i sweat, and I'm generally fearful to say anything, and when or if I would I would stutter everything I said, and I knew classmates and that noticed this and that feeling that there is something wrong with you compared to almost everyone else is horrific and that was the theme of my school days, I was really never bullied or anything like that but I always had the feeling people talked to me in a very condescending way, like (\"I hope he's ok and I should talk to him to make sure he's ok because I would feel horrible if he did something\")\n" +
                    "This bring me into the knock on effect of social anxiety, depression. I have a history of depression since I was about 15. The social anxiety caused me to withdraw from the friends I had at school, I would only really talk to them when I was at school or when I went drinking with them. Alcohol was a scapegoat for the anxiety, I'd drink almost every Friday after school and when I was sedated I wasn't as bad with the illness. But with that the alcohol was a problem of it's own, I relied on it to talk to anyone and drank quiet heavily when I went drinking at the weekends, and the overindulgence of alcohol often led to rational decisions and with the underlining problem of depression, I often took that frustration out on good friends, they lost patience with me and I understand that because I was turning to them every night at one stage to help me with my problems rather than have the courage to talk to a medical profession.\n" +
                    "I finished school at 18 and then went to college at 19. Here the anxiety was a major factor,I felt so out of place that I really refused to go in at all eventually, it was a feeling that I wasn't capable of doing this and the crippling fear of social interactions that ended this after a year of the 4 year course. A few weeks after I dropped out of college I found a job washing dishes in a very busy hotel, it was a really tough job but I needed the money to do a new course so I didn't have to do this job forever as a means of income. I worked the job for a year and had the money to do another course but history repeated itself, it was a poor mistake, I moved in with some people I vaguely knew at all but we all ended up sharing a house with one another. The people in the course and city in general were scumbags to me, the people in the course where all a lot younger than me, cocky, arrogant and all very self centered people to me. It wasn't long before I stopped going in, I think my first semester my attendance was 15%, the lectures where all aware of my depression and discomfort in going to classes and let me do my work at home. I did very little work but did easily pass the first semester. However I made the choice that I couldn't go into class anymore and that's when the depression was at it's worst. I rarely left my room, only to go out and buy alcohol and try drink myself stupid, the idea that I was about to fail another course and waste thousands of euro again was crushing. Self harm followed the alcohol abuse, and worked hand in hand with one another, I'd wake up in the evening, get the cheapest alcohol I could get my hands on(I was broke at this stage) drink myself stupid and then sit in my room and cut literally anywhere I didn't already have a fresh cut on my body. I felt absolutely worthless and often contemplated and thought out in depth plans of suicide.\n" +
                    "Thankfully that was the worst it ever got, my housemates found out what I was doing and called my family and filled them in on what was going on. I was forced to go into a physiotherapy unit and that really didn't help at all, I was in a room full of people that had lost grip with reality, and my problem was depression and social anxiety. I signed in under the condition of free will, that I could leave whenever I wanted, but that turned out not to be the case. After being here for a few hours I had realised the environment was only making me feel alot worse. Even at my worst I was no harm to anyone but myself, i was locked in here tho there was no way out for 5 long grueling days.\n" +
                    "I found a job soon after I got out, I felt grateful to be out of there and despite the fact it was a horrific experience I used it as a motivation. I said to myself I'm not ending up in there again, I'm going to work hard to get out of the hole I dug myself deep into. The new job was a Godsend tho, I'm still doing it to this day, it's involves talking to the general public almost entirely and this in turn has helped me alot with the social anxiety. At first it was a terrifying thing to do but I just said to myself I had to at least try face the fear and I'm glade I did because I have come a long way with my illness, don't get me wrong I still have bad days but I'm making progress and taking it step by step and for once feel like I'm finally winning the war now.\n" +
                    "With this illness it's very easy to seclude yourself alone so you don't have the face your face but my best advice is to talk about the problem, don't bottle it up and try and face it alone. If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone like a medical profession, talk to someone you know you can trust or even through anonymous web forums like this, I'm sure each persons social anxiety and story is different, and just getting it off your chest can help alot I think.\n" +
                    "In summery to where I'm at now, I don't self harm anymore and have strong will" +
                    " power not to ever again, I only drink very rarely and it's normally just a " +
                    "casual pint, and the anxiety and depression is not as bad at all anymore. " +
                    "I'd be more than glade to discuss this topic with other people that feel the " +
                    "same way I did and sometimes still do feel.",
